Generating Authentication Key For Azure API Management in Java


In extension to documentation in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/apimanagement/apimanagementrest/azure-api-management-rest-api-authentication

Azure does not have java documentation to generate the token so after a little struggle I was able to figure it out.

Following java file has the sample code.

Note: Two different date formats need to be used.
